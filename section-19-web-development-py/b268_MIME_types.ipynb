    "There are a few other types available. We need to look at the field `Content-Type`; it uses a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension). Browsers use the MIME type to determine how to process a URL. They look at the `Content-Type` that our Flask app automatically sends to the browser so as to determine what to do with that file.\n",

    "Swapi.co just sends us information, not a webpage. THe content type of the `/people` route is just `application/json`. A website takes this data and may display it. This endpoint, instead of sending HTML, CSS and JS, just sends us the object notation that we need.\n",
