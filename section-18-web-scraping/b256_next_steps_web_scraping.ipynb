    "1. Get more familiar with Beautiful Soup\n",
    "  - ideally, we should just be able to use an API, i.e. Air BnB\n",
    "    - we can read about what data we have access to\n",
    "    - It's a smaller library\n",
    "2. check out [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)\n",
    "  - Beautiful Soup, but with more features\n",
    "  - Such a framework is a whole tool belt for scraping\n",
    "  - One would use it for scraping massive websites\n",
    "  - __A framework practically teaches an entirely new language__\n",
    "3. What are you gonna do with all this data?\n",
    "  - Store it in a text file\n",
    "  - CSV file\n",
    "  - As we collect more data, we might want to look into databases\n",
    "    - massive amounts\n",
    "    - easily accessible\n",
    "    - MongoDB, Redis, MySql, Postgres\n",

    "Be ethical, read robots.txt whenever possible to see what is allowed."
