A thorough review of Python after a 2 year hiatus, here are some notes and code snippets.

The lecture naming conventions I use are merely for emphasis and visibility. In this schema, those lectures...

- without any alpha-numeric prefix whatsoever are mostly written in Python

- prefixed by `a` in are written in Markdown via VS code.

- prefixed `b` are written in Jupyter notebooks so that I can practice the environment per VS Code.

Conclusion: Jupyter Notebooks are far superior for this style of note-taking, as of 20220907.
