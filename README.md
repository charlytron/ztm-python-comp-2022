A thorough review of Python after a 2 year hiatus, here are some notes and code snippets.

The lecture naming conventions I use are merely for emphasis and visibility. In this schema, those lectures...

- without any alpha-numeric prefix whatsoever are mostly written in Python

- prefixed by `a` in are written in Markdown via VS code.

- prefixed `b` are written in Jupyter notebooks so that I can practice the environment per VS Code.

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

This suits my style of note-taking, as of now, not only allowing us to run code in place. __We can test our assumptions about how the code works__, something that wouldn't be possible if we used doc strings to document our code:

__\``` python
print('that/'s not how we roll')
\```__

I've also added the __Ijavascript__ kernel for Jupyter. Using Node, it behaves like the NodeJS REPL. We only need click on `new` and choose the Javascript kernel.

Repo for __IJavascript__ is [here](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript)
