A thorough review of Python after a 2 year hiatus, here are some notes and code snippets.
A note about lecture naming conventions. Merely for emphasis and visibility, those lectures...

- Without any alpha-numeric prefix whatsoever are strictly written in Python

- Prefixed by `a` in are written in Markdown via VS code.

- Prefixed `b` are written in Jupyter notebooks so that I can practice the environment per VS Code.
