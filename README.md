# ztm-python-comp-2022

A thorough review of Python after a 2 year hiatus. I've included some notes and code snippets.
A note about my lecture naming conventions. Those lectures...

- Without any alpha-numeric prefix whatsoever are strictly written in Python

- Prefixed by `a` in are written in Markdown via VS code.

- Prefixed `b` are written in Jupyter notebooks so that I can practice the environment per VS Code.
