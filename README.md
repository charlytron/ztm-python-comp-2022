A thorough review of Python after a 2 year hiatus, here are some notes and code snippets.

The lecture naming conventions I use are merely for emphasis and visibility. In this schema, those lectures...

- without any alpha-numeric prefix whatsoever are mostly written in Python

- prefixed by `a` in are written in Markdown via VS code.

- prefixed `b` are written in Jupyter notebooks so that I can practice the environment per VS Code.

## Using Jupyter Notebooks

This suits my style of note-taking, as of now, allowing us to run code in place. And they follow the DRY plaradigm. No diggity!

Why write the same code chunks across the notebook to have access to already global variables just to write a snippet? All in on this one.

I've also added the __Ijavascript__ kernel for Jupyter. Using Node, it behaves like the NodeJS REPL. We only need click on `new` and choose the Javascript kernel.

Repo for __IJavascript__ is [here](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript)
